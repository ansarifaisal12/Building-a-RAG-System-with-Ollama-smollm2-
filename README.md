# Building-a-RAG-System-with-Ollama-smollm2-
# Financial Document Analysis RAG System

An intelligent document analysis system that combines Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Large Language Models(smollm2) to perform sophisticated financial analysis.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-perspective Analysis:**
  - Financial Metrics Analysis
  - Risk Assessment
  - Market Analysis
- **Specialized Prompts:** Custom-designed prompts for each analysis type
- **Document Processing:** Efficient PDF processing and chunking
- **Advanced Retrieval:** Semantic search using HuggingFace embeddings
- **Structured Output:** Professional-grade financial insights

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **LangChain:** For document processing and RAG implementation
- **smollm2:** Base language model
- **HuggingFace Embeddings:** all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model
- **ChromaDB:** Vector store for efficient retrieval
- **PyPDF:** PDF document processing

## üìã Prerequisites

```bash
pip install langchain chromadb sentence_transformers pypdf ollama
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Install Ollama:**
```bash
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama serve
ollama pull smollm2
```

2. **Initialize the System:**
```python
from finance_rag import FinanceRAG

# Process your document
rag = FinanceRAG()
components = process_financial_document("your_document.pdf")
```

3. **Perform Analysis:**
```python
# Financial Analysis
financial_analysis = analyze_document(components, 
    "What are the key financial metrics?", 'financial')

# Risk Assessment
risk_analysis = analyze_document(components,
    "What are the main risk factors?", 'risk')

# Market Analysis
market_analysis = analyze_document(components,
    "What are the market opportunities?", 'market')
```
